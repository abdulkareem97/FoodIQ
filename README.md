### Problem Statement
Preparing meals can be a challenging task for many individuals, especially those who lack culinary skills and knowledge of different cuisines. Furthermore, identifying ingredients and finding recipes can be time-consuming and frustrating. To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop a food recognition and recipe recommendation system integrated with an online grocery shopping platform. The system aims to help users identify food items from images and provide them with step-by-step instructions on how to prepare the dish. Additionally, the system allows users to purchase the required ingredients directly from an online grocery store, making meal preparation more convenient and less time-consuming. The system aims to simplify meal preparation for individuals who lack culinary skills, are short on time, or want to try new cuisines without the hassle of identifying ingredients and finding recipes.
### Solution
The food recognition and recipe recommendation system is a machine learning-based system that enables users to identify food items from images and provides them with step-by-step instructions on how to prepare the dish. The system uses deep learning algorithms to recognize food items from images and retrieve recipes from a large recipe database. The system also allows users to purchase ingredients from an online grocery store integrated with the system on a single click of a button, such as Jio Mart, if they do not have the required ingredients. The system aims to help users discover new recipes, prepare meals quickly, and conveniently purchase the required ingredients. The system's interface is user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the system and it also built a connection b/w retail grocery store such as jio mart and the users
